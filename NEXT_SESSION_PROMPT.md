## Prompt

I'm working on **Tary**, a flooring contractor management app. Phase 1 is complete and production-ready. I need to implement **Phase 2 features** starting with PDF generation and email integration.

**Current Status:**
- ✅ Full customer-to-contract workflow operational
- ✅ Mobile-optimized, ~3,760 LOC, zero TypeScript errors
- ✅ Authentication, database (Supabase), professional contract generation
- ⚠️ PDF download buttons exist but non-functional
- ⚠️ Email buttons exist but non-functional

**What I Need:**
Implement PDF generation for estimates and contracts, then email integration to send PDFs to customers.

**Context Documents:**
- Read `/memory-bank/activeContext.md` for current state
- Read `/memory-bank/NEXT_FEATURES.md` for detailed requirements
- Read `/memory-bank/progress.md` for what's already built

**Start by reading these files, then propose an implementation plan for PDF generation.**

## Alternative: If You Want to Continue in THIS Session

I can start implementing PDF generation right now! Just say:

**"Start implementing PDF generation for estimates and contracts"**

And I'll:
1. Research best PDF library for Next.js 15
2. Create PDF generation utilities
3. Implement download functionality
4. Test on both estimate and contract pages
5. Update documentation
