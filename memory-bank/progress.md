## üìù Notes for Next Development Session

1. **Start with Customer Wizard** - This is the most visually impressive feature for demos
2. **Focus on Mobile Experience** - Test on actual tablets/phones, not just browser simulation
3. **Real Data Integration** - Use actual flooring industry data for realistic demos
4. **Professional Polish** - Every visible element should look production-ready
5. **Performance First** - Maintain sub-3 second load times on mobile

The foundation is solid and ready for Phase 1 feature development. The next session should focus on the customer wizard implementation as it's the most visually impressive component for client demonstrations.
