## How Tary Works Today

### Your Current Workflow in the App

1. **You log in** to your Tary account
2. **You create a customer** by entering their name, phone, email, address
3. **You select floor options** - type (Red Oak, White Oak, etc.), size, finish, stain
4. **You measure rooms** - enter length × width for each room, stairs if any
5. **The app calculates the price** automatically based on your pricing template
6. **You see the estimate** and can adjust if needed
7. **You see the contract** with all the legal terms from your template
8. **You capture signatures** - customer signs on your phone/tablet, then you sign
9. **You download the PDF** or email it to the customer
10. **You track the project** - status changes from draft → quoted → approved → in progress → completed

### What Customers Can Do Today

**Nothing.** Customers don't have any way to access Tary themselves. Everything goes through you:
- You enter their info
- You show them the estimate on your device
- You hand them your device to sign
- You email or print the PDF for them

## Questions About Customer Access

### Q1: Should customers be able to see their estimate online?

*Today, customers only see estimates when you show them on your phone or email them a PDF.*

**Scenario**: You create an estimate, then text/email the customer a link. They tap it and see their estimate on their own phone.

- Would this be useful?
- When would you use this vs. showing them in person?
- Should they be able to see pricing, or just the scope of work?

---

### Q2: How do you first make contact with a new customer?

*Help us understand your real workflow:*

- Do you usually get their **phone number first**? Or email?
- Do you visit the home **before** creating anything in Tary?
- Or do you sometimes create the estimate **before** meeting them?
- Do customers ever call/text you measurements they've taken themselves?

---

### Q3: Should customers be able to fill out their own information?

*Today, you type in all the customer details yourself.*

**Scenario A**: You get a phone call. You only have their phone number. You text them a link. They fill out their own name, email, address.

**Scenario B**: You're at a home show. Someone's interested. You text them a link to "get a quote" - they fill everything out including rough room sizes.

- Would either of these be useful to you?
- Or do you prefer entering everything yourself for accuracy?

---

### Q4: Should customers measure their own rooms?

*Today, you enter all measurements yourself.*

**Scenario**: Customer wants a ballpark quote before you visit. You send them a link. They enter their room dimensions (even if rough). You see it in Tary and can give them a preliminary number.

- Is this realistic? Would customers do this?
- Would you trust customer measurements for a real quote?
- Or should customer measurements just be a "starting point" you verify later?

---

### Q5: Should customers sign contracts online (not in person)?

*Today, customers sign on your device while you're with them.*

**Scenario**: You've been back and forth with a customer. They're ready to sign. Instead of scheduling another visit, you send them a link. They sign from their phone at home.

- Would you use this?
- Are there situations where you NEED to be there when they sign?
- Do you need to sign too, or could your signature be pre-saved?

---

### Q6: Should customers pay through the app?

*Today, you collect checks/cash/Venmo outside of Tary.*

**Scenario**: Customer clicks "Pay Deposit" in their estimate link. Pays with credit card. You get notified. Money goes to your bank account.

- Would you use online payments?
- Would you pay the ~3% credit card fee, or pass it to customer?
- Which payments would be online vs. in-person?
  - [ ] 60% deposit
  - [ ] 30% mid-project
  - [ ] 10% final
  - [ ] All of them
  - [ ] None - I prefer checks

---

### Q7: Should customers have their own account/login?

**Option A: No accounts** - Every time you send a link, they can access just that one estimate. Simple.

**Option B: Customer accounts** - Customer creates a login. Can see all their past jobs with you, payment history, etc.

- Which sounds more useful?
- Do repeat customers ask you "what did we do last time"?
- Would customers actually create accounts, or is that too much friction?

---

### Q8: What information should customers see vs. NOT see?

When a customer views their estimate online, what should they see?

| Information | Show? |
|-------------|-------|
| Their name and address | Yes / No |
| Floor type and specs | Yes / No |
| Room measurements | Yes / No |
| Price per square foot | Yes / No |
| Total price | Yes / No |
| Your markup/profit | Yes / No |
| Payment schedule (60/30/10) | Yes / No |
| Full contract terms | Yes / No |
| Your phone number | Yes / No |
| Your email | Yes / No |

---

### Q9: How should you share links with customers?

When you want to send a customer their estimate link:

- **Copy link** - You paste it into your own text/email app
- **Text from app** - Tary sends the text directly
- **Email from app** - Tary sends the email directly (this already works)
- **QR code** - Show them a code to scan

Which would you actually use?

---

### Q10: What happens if a customer has questions about their estimate?

After viewing their estimate online, customers might have questions.

- Should there be a way to message you through the app?
- Or just show your phone number and let them call/text normally?
- Should you get notified when they view the estimate?
